[00:00.00][00:36.92][00:42.17][01:06.83][01:35.35][01:59.92][02:24.80][02:49.01][02:52.81]
[00:12.22]Hey kid, don't quit your daydream yet
[00:16.02]I know you feel locked out in the cold
[00:20.76]Seems like you're lost and alone
[00:23.88]Hey kid, don't listen to your head
[00:28.55]It only fills you with dread and with doubt
[00:33.04]Left looking for an easy way out
[00:37.11]I know you don't know
[00:38.43]Oh no you don't know
[00:42.37][00:54.40][01:35.55][01:47.35][02:25.00]I wanna feel happy days, happy days
[00:45.30][00:58.22][01:38.13][01:50.60][02:28.19]Happy days, happy days
[00:48.77][01:41.09][02:30.75]Walls of isolation inside of my pain
[00:51.34][01:03.56][01:43.63][01:59.42][02:33.66][02:46.25]And I don't know if I'm ready to change
[01:01.17][01:56.20][02:43.21]All of this frustration inside of my brain
[01:11.39]Some nights you call for the jaws of life
[01:14.93]To pull you out of the crash
[01:18.98]A forgotten ghost from your past
[01:23.53]When enough doesn't cut it
[01:26.04]When you're backed up against a wall
[01:29.69]Is it the life that you wanted
[01:32.49]When you could never have it all
[02:00.10]Face down in the deep end
[02:04.32]Face down every weekend
[02:07.57]Face down and I'm bleeding
[02:10.68]There's no sound when you're leaving
[02:13.52]We faced all of our demons
[02:16.72]We chased all of our dreams and
[02:20.21]Don't know where it leads us
[02:22.93]We don't care at all
[02:36.50]I wanna feel happy days, happy days (face down in the deep end)
[02:40.65]Happy days, happy days (face down every weekend)
[02:49.69]I wanna feel happy days
